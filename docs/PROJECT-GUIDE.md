# Project Guide — ACME Facility Incident Management

**Who this is for.** The owner of this repository, who did not write the code and
needs to understand every part of it in depth. It assumes you can read Python and
TypeScript but not that you know FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Terraform, CloudFront or
this workshop's scaffold. Every non-obvious term is defined in the glossary of the
phase where it first appears.

**How this differs from the README.** The README is for graders: setup steps,
architecture summary, how to run the tests. This guide is the *why* — the
decisions, the alternatives that were rejected, and the things that will bite you.

**How it is written.** One section per build phase, appended while the reasoning
was still fresh. [docs/BUILD-PLAN.md](BUILD-PLAN.md) says what each phase builds;
[CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) holds the scaffold constraints that are not negotiable.
Where a decision was *forced* by the scaffold or the AWS IAM boundary rather than
freely chosen, this guide says so explicitly.

---

## Phase M1 — Scaffold and walking skeleton

A "walking skeleton" is a thin slice through every layer of the system that does
almost nothing useful, but proves the whole path works: browser → API → database,
locally and deployed. The point is to discover routing, packaging and permission
problems on day one instead of on the last day.

### 1. What was built

#### Backend — `backend/v1/`

| File | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| [function.py](../backend/v1/function.py) | AWS Lambda entry point. Routes each event either to the ASGI app (HTTP) or to an ops action (direct invoke). |
| [app/main.py](../backend/v1/app/main.py) | Builds the FastAPI application and mounts every router under `/api/v1`. |
| [app/config.py](../backend/v1/app/config.py) | `Settings` — reads the environment Terraform injects; builds the database URL. Owns the `API_PREFIX` constant. |
| [app/db.py](../backend/v1/app/db.py) | Creates the SQLAlchemy engine and session factory once per process; `get_db` is the FastAPI request dependency. |
| [app/routers/health.py](../backend/v1/app/routers/health.py) | `GET /api/v1/health`. Thin: takes a session, calls the service, returns the model. |
| [app/services/health.py](../backend/v1/app/services/health.py) | The actual health logic — probe PostgreSQL, assemble the report. Holds `API_VERSION`. |
| [app/services/ops.py](../backend/v1/app/services/ops.py) | The `ACTIONS` registry and `run_ops` dispatcher for direct-invoke operations. |
| [app/schemas/health.py](../backend/v1/app/schemas/health.py) | Pydantic response models. The frontend's TypeScript interfaces mirror these. |
| [requirements.txt](../backend/v1/requirements.txt) | **Runtime deps only.** Terraform reads this file to build the Lambda package. |
| [requirements-dev.txt](../backend/v1/requirements-dev.txt) | Test and lint tooling. Terraform never sees it. |
| [pyproject.toml](../backend/v1/pyproject.toml) | ruff and pytest configuration. Not a package definition. |
| `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/` | 19 tests. Unit: settings and URL building, ops dispatch, handler routing. Integration: the health endpoint against a real PostgreSQL. |

#### Frontend — `frontend/`

Converted from the scaffold's JavaScript React app to TypeScript, and given the
libraries the rest of the build needs.

| File | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| [src/main.tsx](../frontend/src/main.tsx) | Mounts React and wraps the app in the four providers: TanStack Query, MUI theme, `CssBaseline`, React Router. |
| [src/App.tsx](../frontend/src/App.tsx) | The route table. One route today. |
| [src/theme.ts](../frontend/src/theme.ts) | MUI theme: palette, typography, corner radius. |
| [src/api/client.ts](../frontend/src/api/client.ts) | The shared axios instance. `baseURL: '/api/v1'`, `withCredentials: true`. |
| [src/api/health.ts](../frontend/src/api/health.ts) | `fetchHealth()` plus the TypeScript types mirroring `app/schemas/health.py`. |
| [src/api/queryKeys.ts](../frontend/src/api/queryKeys.ts) | Central registry of TanStack Query cache keys. |
| [src/hooks/useBreakpoint.ts](../frontend/src/hooks/useBreakpoint.ts) | `isMobile` / `isDesktop` from `react-responsive`, pinned to MUI's 900 px `md` breakpoint. |
| [src/features/status/useHealth.ts](../frontend/src/features/status/useHealth.ts) | The TanStack Query hook. Polls every 30 s. |
| [src/features/status/StatusPage.tsx](../frontend/src/features/status/StatusPage.tsx) | The placeholder page. Renders healthy / degraded / unreachable. |
| [src/test/viewport.ts](../frontend/src/test/viewport.ts) | A controllable `window.matchMedia` so responsive behaviour is testable. |
| [src/test/setup.ts](../frontend/src/test/setup.ts) | Vitest setup: jest-dom matchers, Testing Library cleanup, the matchMedia install. |
| [vite.config.ts](../frontend/vite.config.ts) | Dev server on :3000, the `/api` proxy, and the Vitest configuration. |
| `tsconfig*.json`, [eslint.config.js](../frontend/eslint.config.js) | TypeScript project references; TypeScript-aware flat ESLint config. |

Deleted from the scaffold: `App.jsx`, `main.jsx`, `App.css`, `index.css`,
`vite.config.js`, the Vite and React logos, and the empty `src/pages/` and
`src/services/` placeholder directories (the layout in BUILD-PLAN.md uses
`features/` and `api/` instead).

#### Infrastructure — the three permitted `infra/` edits

1. **[lambda.tf](../infra/lambda.tf)** — `memory_size` 128 → 512.
2. **[locals.tf](../infra/locals.tf)** — a `random_password.jwt_secret` resource, and
   `JWT_SECRET` added to `local.env_vars`.
3. **[cloudfront.tf](../infra/cloudfront.tf)** — deleted the distribution-wide
   `custom_error_response` (404 → 200 `/index.html`) and replaced it with a
   CloudFront Function bound to the default cache behaviour only.

#### CI

- **[.github/workflows/ci.actions.yml](../.github/workflows/ci.actions.yml)** (new) —
  a `backend` job (PostgreSQL 17 service container, `ruff check`, `ruff format
  --check`, `pytest`) and a `frontend` job (`eslint`, `tsc -b`, `vitest`, `vite build`).
- **[.bandit](../.bandit)** (new) + a one-line change to
  [.github/workflows/python.actions.yml](../.github/workflows/python.actions.yml) —
  see Gotchas.

### 2. Why it is shaped this way

**One service directory, named `v1`.** *Forced by the scaffold.*
`infra/locals.tf` globs `backend/*/requirements.txt` one level deep and turns every
match into its own Lambda with a **public, unauthenticated** Function URL.
`infra/cloudfront.tf` then routes `/api/<dir-name>*` to it. So the directory name
*is* the API version prefix. Creating `backend/anything-else/requirements.txt` would
silently publish a second, unprotected API.

**Routes carry the full `/api/v1` prefix.** *Forced by the scaffold.* CloudFront
forwards the path **unmodified**, so the Lambda genuinely receives
`/api/v1/auth/login`. Two consequences:

- Routers are mounted with `prefix=API_PREFIX`, and the OpenAPI docs live at
  `/api/v1/docs` — mounting them at `/docs` would make them unreachable in the
  cloud, because CloudFront only sends `/api/v1*` to the Lambda.
- Local development uses Vite's own proxy, **not** `bin/proxy-server.js`. That
  script strips the `/api/<name>` prefix, which would make local paths differ from
  deployed ones — exactly the class of bug a walking skeleton exists to prevent.

**Rejected:** FastAPI's `root_path`. It changes how URLs are *generated* but the
app would still need the prefix on incoming paths, so it adds indirection without
removing the constant.

**Layer-first code layout** (`routers/`, `services/`, `schemas/`, …) rather than
feature-first (`incidents/{router,service,schema}.py`). With eight domains and a
rubric that asks "where does rule X live?", one directory per layer makes the
answer mechanical. The trade-off — a change to one feature touches several
directories — is handled by the recipes in section 5.

**A `health` ops action, not just an ASGI passthrough.** `function.py` implements
the full dispatch shape from CLAUDE.md now, in M1, rather than bolting it on in M2
when migrations need it. Registering a real action (`health`) rather than an empty
registry means the mechanism is exercised and tested from day one, and gives us the
only way to check that the Lambda can reach Aurora — Aurora is
`publicly_accessible = false`, so nothing on your machine can connect to it.

**`GET /health` returns HTTP 200 even when the database is down**, with
`status: "degraded"` in the body. *Chosen, not forced.* The status page must be
able to *render* a database outage; if the endpoint returned 503, axios would throw
and the page would report "API unreachable", which is the wrong diagnosis. Nothing
in this stack reads the status code (CloudFront fronts a Lambda Function URL, not a
load balancer with health checks). If a real orchestrator is ever added, add a
separate strict endpoint rather than changing this one.

**Only the exception *type* is returned when the probe fails.** Driver error
messages can echo host names and connection parameters. The full traceback goes to
the CloudWatch log; the client sees `"OperationalError"`.

**`Settings.database_url` returns a SQLAlchemy `URL` object, not a string.**
Aurora generates passwords containing characters that are unsafe in a URL
(`/`, `@`, `:`, `#`). `URL.create()` escapes them; string interpolation would
silently produce a broken connection string. There is a test for exactly this.

**Development defaults live in `config.py`, values live in the environment.**
Every setting has a default matching the local PostgreSQL install, so `uvicorn`
starts with no setup. Terraform's injected variables override them in the cloud.
Nothing is hardcoded in the sense that matters: no cloud value ever appears in code.

**bcrypt/JWT/Alembic are *not* in `requirements.txt` yet.** They arrive in M2 with
the code that uses them. `requirements.txt` is the Lambda package manifest, so
every line in it is weight in the deployment zip.

**`memory_size` 512.** 128 MB is not enough to import FastAPI + SQLAlchemy +
psycopg. Lambda also scales CPU with memory, so the larger setting materially
reduces cold-start time.

**The CloudFront 404 fix.** The scaffold mapped *every* 404 on the distribution to
a 200 serving `/index.html`. That includes the API origin — so `GET
/api/v1/incidents/{unknown-id}` would reach the browser as **HTTP 200 with a page
of HTML**. That breaks REST semantics and the rubric. A viewer-request CloudFront
Function attached to the **default behaviour only** gives SPA deep links without
ever seeing `/api/v1*`, because those requests match the API `ordered_cache_behavior`
instead.

**Rejected:** keeping `custom_error_response` and scoping it somehow — CloudFront
custom error responses are distribution-wide and cannot be scoped to a behaviour.

**`JWT_SECRET` from `random_password`, not Secrets Manager.** The IAM boundary does
grant `secretsmanager` on matching ARNs, so Secrets Manager was possible; it was
rejected for M1 because it adds a runtime API call (and its failure modes) to every
cold start for a single value. The generated password lives in Terraform state,
which is in a private S3 bucket. If this were a real production system, Secrets
Manager with rotation would be the right answer — this is stated here so the
trade-off is visible rather than accidental.

**Frontend: TanStack Query rather than hand-rolled `useEffect` fetching.** Every
later screen needs caching, background refresh and invalidation after mutations.

**Frontend: no `VITE_API_URL`.** `bin/deploy-frontend.sh` exports one, and we
ignore it. All calls are relative to `/api/v1`, because the browser is always
same-origin with the API — CloudFront fronts both origins in the cloud, and the
Vite proxy does the same locally. Same-origin in *both* environments is what makes
the `SameSite=Strict` HttpOnly refresh cookie in M2 work without special cases.

### 3. How the pieces connect

One request, hop by hop. **Locally:**

```
Browser (localhost:3000)
  │  StatusPage.tsx renders, useHealth() runs
  ▼
useHealth.ts            TanStack Query, key ['health']  ──► cache miss
  ▼
api/health.ts           fetchHealth()
  ▼
api/client.ts           axios GET  baseURL '/api/v1'  +  '/health'
  ▼
vite.config.ts          server.proxy['/api'] → http://localhost:8000
                        path forwarded UNCHANGED: /api/v1/health
  ▼
uvicorn :8000 ──► app/main.py       FastAPI, routers mounted at /api/v1
  ▼
app/routers/health.py   read_health(session = Depends(get_db))
  ▼
app/db.py               get_db() → sessionmaker → engine (built from Settings)
  ▼
app/services/health.py  check_database(session) → SELECT version()
  ▼
PostgreSQL (localhost:5432)
  ▲
  │  DatabaseHealth(status='ok', version='PostgreSQL 18.6 …')
app/services/health.py  build_health_report() → HealthReport
  ▲
app/schemas/health.py   Pydantic serialises to JSON
  ▲
StatusPage.tsx          TanStack Query caches under ['health'], component re-renders
                        → chips: "API healthy", "Database ok", "Environment: local"
```

**Deployed**, the two middle hops change and nothing else does:

```
Browser (https://d1234.cloudfront.net)
  ▼
CloudFront
  ├─ /api/v1*   ordered_cache_behavior → Lambda Function URL      ← our request
  │              (managed policies: no caching, AllViewerExceptHostHeader)
  └─ everything else → default_cache_behavior → S3 (private, OAC)
                       with the spa_router CloudFront Function on viewer-request
  ▼
Lambda Function URL → function.handler(event, context)
  ▼
function.py             event has no "action" key → Mangum translates the
                        Lambda event into an ASGI scope
  ▼
app/main.py → … → Aurora PostgreSQL (private subnets, sslmode=require)
```

**The ops path** bypasses HTTP entirely:

```
aws lambda invoke --function-name coding-workshop-v1-<id> \
    --payload '{"action":"health"}' /dev/stdout
  ▼
function.handler → sees "action" → run_ops("health", event)
  ▼
app/services/ops.py  ACTIONS["health"] → _op_health
  ▼
app/services/health.py → Aurora
```

This is IAM-protected and has no CloudFront route, which is why migrations and
seeding can live here safely from M2 onwards.

### 4. Where the rules live

| Rule / behaviour | File | Detail |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Every route starts with `/api/v1` | [app/config.py](../backend/v1/app/config.py) | `API_PREFIX`, applied in `app/main.py` |
| Database connection details | [app/config.py](../backend/v1/app/config.py) | `Settings`; `database_url` adds `sslmode=require` when not local |
| Cookie `Secure` flag | [app/config.py](../backend/v1/app/config.py) | `Settings.cookie_secure` — false locally, true deployed |
| Connection pooling / engine lifetime | [app/db.py](../backend/v1/app/db.py) | One engine per process, `pool_size=1`, `pool_pre_ping` |
| What "healthy" means | [app/services/health.py](../backend/v1/app/services/health.py) | `build_health_report` |
| Which direct-invoke actions exist | [app/services/ops.py](../backend/v1/app/services/ops.py) | the `ACTIONS` dict |
| HTTP vs. ops routing | [function.py](../backend/v1/function.py) | presence of an `action` key |
| Mobile vs. desktop cut-off | [src/hooks/useBreakpoint.ts](../frontend/src/hooks/useBreakpoint.ts) | `MOBILE_MAX_WIDTH = 899` |
| API base path (frontend) | [src/api/client.ts](../frontend/src/api/client.ts) | `API_BASE_URL` |
| Query cache keys | [src/api/queryKeys.ts](../frontend/src/api/queryKeys.ts) | one registry |
| Local `/api` proxying | [frontend/vite.config.ts](../frontend/vite.config.ts) | `server.proxy`, path unchanged |
| SPA deep-link routing (deployed) | [infra/cloudfront.tf](../infra/cloudfront.tf) | `aws_cloudfront_function.spa_router` |
| Lambda env vars | [infra/locals.tf](../infra/locals.tf) | `local.env_vars` |

### 5. How to change it

**Add an API endpoint.**
1. `app/schemas/<domain>.py` — request and response models.
2. `app/services/<domain>.py` — the logic. Routes stay thin.
3. `app/routers/<domain>.py` — an `APIRouter`, one function per route.
4. `app/main.py` — `application.include_router(<domain>.router, prefix=API_PREFIX)`.
5. `tests/` — a unit test for the rule, an integration test for the endpoint.
6. `frontend/src/api/<domain>.ts` — the typed client function and its interfaces.

**Add a Lambda environment variable.**
1. `infra/locals.tf` — add it to `local.env_vars` (it is skipped automatically if empty).
2. `backend/v1/app/config.py` — add the matching field to `Settings`, with a
   development default.
3. Redeploy with `./bin/deploy-backend.sh`.

**Add a direct-invoke ops action** (this is how M2's `migrate` will land).
1. Write `def _op_<name>(event: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:` in
   `app/services/ops.py`.
2. Add it to the `ACTIONS` dict.
3. Add a test in `tests/unit/test_ops.py`.
4. Run it: `aws lambda invoke --function-name <fn> --payload '{"action":"<name>"}' /dev/stdout`.

**Add a page.**
1. `frontend/src/features/<feature>/<Page>.tsx`, plus a `use<Thing>.ts` query hook.
2. Add the `<Route>` to `src/App.tsx`.
3. Add a test beside the component.

**Change the mobile breakpoint.** One constant: `MOBILE_MAX_WIDTH` in
`src/hooks/useBreakpoint.ts`. Keep it one pixel below an MUI breakpoint so
`react-responsive` and MUI's `sx` breakpoints agree.

**Run everything locally.**
```sh
cd backend/v1 && .venv/bin/uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000   # terminal 1
cd frontend   && npm run dev                                           # terminal 2 → :3000
```

**Run the checks** (the same ones CI runs):
```sh
cd backend/v1 && .venv/bin/ruff check . && .venv/bin/ruff format --check . && .venv/bin/python -m pytest
cd frontend   && npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm test && npm run build
cd infra      && terraform fmt -check && terraform validate
bandit --ini .bandit -r ./backend
```

### 6. Gotchas

**Never create a second `backend/<name>/requirements.txt`.** It provisions another
Lambda with a **public, unauthenticated** Function URL. The same trap exists in
`data/` — a `requirements.txt` there triggers EKS and Helm.

**The Lambda handler name is hardcoded to `function.handler`** in
`infra/locals.tf`. `function.py` must stay at the root of `backend/v1/` and expose
a module-level `handler`. The runtime is hardcoded to `python3.13`.

**The virtualenv must stay dot-prefixed.** The Lambda packaging patterns in
`infra/locals.tf` are `["!__pycache__/.*", "!\\..*"]` — the second excludes
anything starting with a dot, which is the only thing keeping `backend/v1/.venv`
(~150 MB) out of the deployment zip. A venv named `venv/` would be packaged and the
deploy would fail. The `tests/` directory *is* packaged; it is small and harmless,
and excluding it would mean editing `infra/locals.tf` beyond the permitted change.

**Aurora Serverless v2 runs at `min_capacity = 0.0`.** It sleeps when idle and
takes roughly 15 seconds to wake. A hung first request after a quiet period is
almost always this, not a bug. `postgres_connect_timeout` is 30 s for that reason,
and the frontend's TanStack Query default retries once.

**Aurora is not reachable from your machine** (`publicly_accessible = false`).
Migrations, seeding and any direct SQL must go through `aws lambda invoke` with an
`action` payload. This is a constraint, not a preference.

**`ENVIRONMENT.config` holds live AWS STS credentials.** It is gitignored. Never
commit it, echo it, or paste it anywhere. The credentials expire every few hours;
re-run `./bin/setup-participant.sh`.

**`npm ci` cannot be used.** The scaffold's `.gitignore` excludes
`package-lock.json`, so CI runs `npm install`. Dependency versions are therefore
resolved fresh on every CI run within the semver ranges in `package.json`.

**Bandit needed a config file.** `.github/workflows/python.actions.yml` runs
`bandit -r ./backend` on every push, and bandit exits non-zero on *any* finding —
including `B101` for the `assert` in every pytest test. Bandit does **not**
auto-discover `.bandit`, so the workflow was changed to `bandit --ini .bandit -r
./backend`. The config excludes only `backend/v1/.venv` and `backend/v1/tests`;
no rule is disabled and application code is scanned in full.

**Material UI v9 removed system props from components.** `alignItems`,
`justifyContent` and `fontWeight` are no longer accepted directly on `<Stack>` or
`<Typography>` — they must go inside `sx={{ … }}`. The TypeScript error for this
is long and unhelpful; the fix is always the same.

**jsdom has no layout, so `react-responsive` cannot work in tests** without help:
every width query reports `matches: false`. `src/test/viewport.ts` installs a
controllable `window.matchMedia`, and `src/test/setup.ts` calls it *before* any
test module loads — `react-responsive` captures `window.matchMedia` when it is
first imported, so stubbing it inside a test is too late.

**Testing Library does not auto-clean when Vitest globals are off.** We import
`describe`/`it`/`expect` explicitly, so `src/test/setup.ts` registers
`afterEach(cleanup)` by hand. Without it, each test's DOM leaks into the next
test's queries and failures become very confusing.

**`docs/` is not `data/`.** Leave `backend/_examples/`, `data/`, `infra/helm/`,
`infra/eks.tf` and `infra/documentdb.tf` alone — they belong to other workshop tracks.

### 7. Glossary

**ASGI** — Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface. The Python convention for how a
web server hands a request to a web framework. FastAPI speaks ASGI; uvicorn and
Mangum are two different things that can speak it to FastAPI.

**Mangum** — a small adapter that translates an AWS Lambda event into an ASGI
request and the ASGI response back into a Lambda response, so a FastAPI app can run
on Lambda unchanged. `lifespan="off"` skips the ASGI startup/shutdown hooks, which
we do not use.

**uvicorn** — the ASGI server used for local development. In the cloud there is no
server: Lambda invokes `function.handler` directly.

**Lambda Function URL** — a built-in HTTPS endpoint on a Lambda function, an
alternative to API Gateway. The workshop IAM boundary does not permit
`apigateway:*`, so this is how the API is exposed. `authorization_type = "NONE"`
means the URL itself is public — CloudFront is what puts it behind one origin.

**CloudFront** — AWS's CDN. Here it is doing routing, not just caching: one
distribution serves the React app from S3 and forwards `/api/v1*` to the Lambda, so
the browser sees a single origin.

**Cache behaviour** — a CloudFront rule matching a path pattern to an origin. The
`default_cache_behavior` catches everything not matched by an
`ordered_cache_behavior`.

**CloudFront Function** — a tiny JavaScript function CloudFront runs at the edge on
every request (`viewer-request`) or response. Restricted runtime, sub-millisecond,
no network access. Ours rewrites extension-less paths to `/index.html`.

**OAC (Origin Access Control)** — the mechanism that lets CloudFront read a private
S3 bucket. The bucket blocks public access; its policy grants `s3:GetObject` only to
the CloudFront service principal for this distribution.

**SPA routing / deep link** — a single-page app renders `/incidents/abc` in the
browser with JavaScript, but if you reload that URL the server is asked for a file
at that path, which does not exist. Rewriting to `/index.html` lets React Router
take over.

**Aurora Serverless v2** — a managed PostgreSQL that scales capacity automatically,
measured in **ACUs** (Aurora Capacity Units, roughly 2 GiB of RAM each).
`min_capacity = 0.0` means it can scale to zero and sleep.

**SQLAlchemy `Engine` / `Session`** — the `Engine` owns the connection pool and is
created once per process; a `Session` is a short-lived unit of work borrowed from
that pool for one request.

**`pool_pre_ping`** — SQLAlchemy sends a trivial query before handing out a pooled
connection, and transparently replaces it if it is dead. Necessary because Aurora
drops idle connections as it scales down.

**Pydantic / pydantic-settings** — Pydantic validates and serialises data from type
annotations; `BaseSettings` is the variant that reads those values from environment
variables and `.env` files.

**ruff** — a fast Python linter and formatter, replacing flake8, isort and black.
`ruff check` lints, `ruff format` formats.

**Bandit** — a static analyser that looks for common Python security mistakes
(hardcoded passwords, `eval`, insecure hashes).

**Vite** — the frontend build tool and dev server. `vite build` produces the static
`dist/` that is uploaded to S3.

**Vitest** — the test runner that shares Vite's config and transform pipeline.

**jsdom** — a JavaScript implementation of the DOM, so component tests can run in
Node without a browser. It parses and renders structure but does **no layout**,
which is why element sizes and media queries are not real.

**TanStack Query** — client-side server-state cache. A `queryKey` identifies cached
data; a mutation invalidates keys to trigger refetches.

**Flat ESLint config** — ESLint's current format: `eslint.config.js` exports an
array of config objects, replacing the older `.eslintrc` cascade.

**Conventional commits** — commit messages prefixed with a type (`feat:`, `fix:`,
`test:`, `infra:`, `docs:`) so history is scannable.
